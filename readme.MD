## Description

This is a side project [my friend Raul](https://github.com/Ortegar952) and I in collaboration to test what we knew about git, using remote repositories and working remotely on the same page. We took most of our inspiration from [this website](https://goo.gl/3yUpzT) as we challenged ourselves to try and replicate it with what we know of web development.

## The Website

Anyone can check the website with this link: https://goo.gl/dFkiQ8.

We tried making it as responsive as possible but if it isn't responsive on your device, we truly apologize for it and we'll fix it as soon as possible if you include the device you are using.
